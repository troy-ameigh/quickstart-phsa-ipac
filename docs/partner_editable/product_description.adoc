This Quick Start deploys Providence Health Care Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) for CLABSI on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. The deployment retrieves bulk patient data in Microsoft Excel format from an on-premises source. AWS Lambda functions transform data into individual infection cases and  display these to reviewers using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Infection control practitioners review cases and manually label those that meet clinical criteria as confirmed CLASBI infections.
