This Quick Start deploys Providence Health Care Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) for CLABSI on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. The deployment retrieves bulk patient data in Microsoft Excel format from an on-premises source. AWS Lambda functions transform data into individual infection cases and display these to reviewers using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. Infection control practitioners and physicians conduct two rounds of reviews on each case and label those that meet clinical criteria as confirmed CLASBI infections. Reviewers also enter reasons for their decisions in the Ground Truth user interface. Confirmed CLABSI cases, including all data collected during the review process, are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for reporting.
