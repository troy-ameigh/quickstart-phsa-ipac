== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

*Important:* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.
For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation].


== Troubleshooting

*Q.* GroundTruth Label job fails to lunch. 

*A.* This Error could be due to Lambda Functions failing, this can be observed by accessing the cloudwatch and looking at the event.

Reasons for failure could be due to input file not having the correct column names, and data, or date format. 

We expect an excell file with 2 sheets in the Landing-Zone bucket to start the process:

*.* The first sheet need these column names and their expected datatype.
